# Using-ML-to-predict-heart-diseases
In todayâ€™s world technology has become a very integral part of medicine. Machine learning is the science
and art of programming computers so they can learn from the data and experience. Furthermore, Machine
Learning is also used in a variety of medicinal fields. It is used by medical researchers and clinicians to
study disease, make predictions, invent medicines, treat disease, etc. For this project, I wanted to see
how useful machine learning can be in studying and predicting diseases. So, I have taken a dataset from
Kaggle to learn about predicting heart disease using certain attributes and see if there is a relationship
between the variables using different models. The presence of heart disease is denoted by the
distinguished presence from the values from 1,2,3,4 and absence value of 0.

For this project, I want to show the broader use of statistics. I will be using different models to
check what is the best way to predict the presence of heart disease in the patient. Some of the models that
I will be using are Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVC, KNN etc.
